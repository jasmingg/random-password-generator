As a mini-website that's fully functional, here's what you can toy around with:
- Enter any number that you desire your password to be. Here's the catch: you'll get an error when you click generate if the length is more than 20.
- Click the toggle button to turn on or off symbols in your password if need be.
- Finally, click the light/dark mode button at the top right if you prefer a light screen or a dark one. There's a reason the default is dark though...
